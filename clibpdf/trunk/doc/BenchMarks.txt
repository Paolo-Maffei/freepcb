Benchmark comparisons of ClibPDF, PDFlib, Adobe PDF Library,
and PostScript generator + Adobe Acrobat Distiller.

The following benchmark results have been provided by a user at a
major manufacturer.  The test application is a conversion program,
equivalently written for each library, that read in a 155-page
(98304 bytes) file containing a parts list for a highly complex
product, and generated a properly formatted version in PDF resulting
in a 156 page file (including a cover page).  Each page contains
mostly text, form lines and a corporate logo as an image.

Platform: Sparc 5 with 64MB memory:

## ClibPDF library [v1.00] (write only) from FastIO Systems:

Conversion time: 15 seconds.
Resultant PDF size: 257,027 bytes.
Compression: Flate compression.
Bookmarking support: yes.
Serialization support: no.
Image support: jpeg.

## PDFlib [v0.6] (write only) from Thomas Merz:

Conversion time: 80 seconds.
Resultant PDF size: 1,314,084 bytes.
Compression: none supported yet.
Bookmarking support: yes.
Serialization support: no.
Image support: jpeg and gif.

## PDF Library (read/modify/write) from Adobe (aka BigKahuna):

Conversion time: 54 seconds.
Resultant PDF size:  284,365 bytes.
Compression: LZW compression.
Bookmarking support: yes.
Serialization support: yes.
Image support: raw only.

## PostScript generator code (from print agent) and Acrobat Distiller:

Requires two step conversion:
	PostScript conversion time: 7 seconds.
	Distiller conversion time:  3 minutes 14 seconds.
Resultant PDF size: 197,548 bytes.
Compression: LZW compression.
Bookmarking support: yes.
Serialization support: no.
Image support: everything in Postscript.

ClibPDF has also been used successfully to convert a massive parts list
file (originally 7.2MB) into a 9255-page PDF file (15.2MB).
