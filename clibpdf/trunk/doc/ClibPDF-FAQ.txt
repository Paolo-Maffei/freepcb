Q1: How do I display the Euro character using ClibPDF?

A1: Use Times or Helvetica family of fonts, WinAnsiEncoding, and octal code \200.
    That is, for example:
	cpdf_setFont(pdf, "Times-Italic", "WinAnsiEncoding", 48.0);
	cpdf_text(pdf, 1.0, 6.5, 0.0, "Hello Euro \200 !");



Q2: A CGI that generates PDF output to stdout under Windows produces bad PDF files.
   However, saving to file works fine.  I am using the following scheme to perform
   PDF output to stdout.  What am I doing wrong?

    bufPDF = cpdf_getBufferForPDF(pdf, &length);
    printf("Content-Type: application/pdf%c", 10);
    printf("Content-Length: %d%c%c", length, 10, 10);
    fwrite((void *)bufPDF, 1, (size_t)length, stdout);	/* Send PDF now */

A2: The above works fine under Unix, but Windows performs end-of-line translations
    which is difficult to disable especially for stdin/stdout.  A solution is to
    use setmode() on stdout as below:

Change the above to:
#if defined(_WIN32) || defined(WIN32)
#include <fcntl.h>
extern int setmode(int filenum, int mode);
#endif
 ....

    bufPDF = cpdf_getBufferForPDF(pdf, &length);
    setmode(fileno(stdout), O_BINARY);			/* ADD: change stdout to binary mode */
    printf("Content-Type: application/pdf%c", 10);
    printf("Content-Length: %d%c%c", length, 10, 10);
    fwrite((void *)bufPDF, 1, (size_t)length, stdout);	/* Send PDF now */




Q: Problems with PDF, Netscape 4.x, SSL Web Server

We are using PDFs on an Extranet (with SSL enabled), and have erratic
problems viewing them with Netscape 4.0 while IE browsers seem to work
just fine.  When clicking on a link to a PDF, some open up in the
browser, while others do not.  Any suggestions?!

That's a known Netscape 4.x bug. Here is the workaround provided by the folks at Netscape:
Exit Netscape, then add this to the end of your prefs.js file (in the Netscape folder):

user_pref("browser.cache.disk_cache_ssl", true);

Then launch Netscape again.
After you do this, you can open pdf files served via SSL.
