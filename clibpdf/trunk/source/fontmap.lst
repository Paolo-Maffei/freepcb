# Font directory paths specified by $Font_Directories will be
# prepended to each entry within (), UNLESS the entry starts with
# strings noted by $Abs_Path_Prefix.  These two must appear BEFORE all
# font map specifications.  Do not include the last '\' in the directory spec.
# These two $* specs must occur together.  Having only one spec is not allowed.
# Specifying no $* at all IS allowed, in which case the spec in () is used as is.
# Upto 10 items of each less than 8 chars are allowed for $Abs_Path_Prefix.
# In this way, most entries may be specified by filenames alone when they
# are located in a common font directory.  Yet, non-standard font locations
# are also allowed by specifying absolute paths explicitly.


# --- Example for Windows: These two lines must come BEFORE actual font mapping spec. --
# $Font_Directories	(-- Directory path for PFM --)	(-- Directory path for PFB --)
# $Font_Directories	(\Library\Resources\Fonts\gs)	(\Library\Resources\Fonts\gs\pfb)
# $Abs_Path_Prefix	(\)	(c:\)	(e:\)

# --- Example for Unix: These two lines must come BEFORE actual font mapping spec. --
# $Font_Directories	(/usr/local/lib/ghostscript/fonts)	(/usr/local/lib/ghostscript/fonts)

# Font Name is the name passed to cpdf_setFont().  Only if you use fontmap file,
# Name for cpdf_setFont() may differ from the actual filenames (basename).
# Font Name does NOT have to be the real name of the font as defined within
# PFM/PFB files.  For example, the real name of "AA-UtopiaMedium" is "UtopiaMedium"
